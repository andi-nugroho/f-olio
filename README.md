## 📜 Description

This project presents a unique and modern way to showcase a professional profile or resume. Instead of a traditional static page, it fetches data from a `resume.json` file and displays it within an interactive, code-like interface. The profile information is dynamically typed out using **TypeIt.js**, complete with syntax highlighting, giving it a distinct, tech-savvy feel.

Key information like account URLs and email addresses within the JSON data are automatically converted into clickable links. The project features a sleek, dark green gradient theme and is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes.

The primary goal is to offer an engaging and visually appealing alternative for developers and tech professionals to present their skills and experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andi-nugroho/f-olio.git
    cd f-olio
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No server or build process is needed as it runs entirely client-side.

## ⚙️ Usage & Customization

This project is designed to be easily adaptable for your own profile. Here’s how:

1.  **Edit `resume.json`:**
    *   This file contains all the profile information displayed.
    *   Open `resume.json` and carefully replace the **values** for each key with your own details (name, field, about_me, skills, technologies, account URLs, etc.).
    *   **Crucially, maintain the existing key structure** (e.g., `"name"`, `"field"`, `"accounts"`, `"accounts.github"`). The JavaScript relies on these specific keys to find and display the data correctly, including making the account URLs clickable.
    *   For paragraph breaks within strings like `"about_me"`, use `\n\n`. The script will convert these into `<br>` tags for proper line breaks in the display.

2.  **Update Footer Social Links (`index.html`):**
    *   Open `index.html`.
    *   Locate the `<footer class="site-footer">` section.
    *   Inside `<div class="social-links">`, update the `href` attribute for each `<a>` tag to point to your actual profile URLs.
    *   Add or remove `<a>` tags and their corresponding Font Awesome icons (`<i>`) to match the accounts you have listed in your `resume.json`.

3.  **Update Copyright Name (`index.html`):**
    *   In the footer section, find `<p class="copyright">`.
    *   Change the name "Andi" to your name or desired alias.

4.  **(Optional) Customize Styles (`style.css`):**
    *   If you wish to change the appearance (colors, fonts, spacing, animations), you can modify the rules within the `style.css` file.
